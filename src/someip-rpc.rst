   This document specifies the Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP) – an
   automotive/embedded RPC mechanism and the underlying serialization / on-wire format.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_697
   :reqtype: Information

   The only valid abbreviation is SOME/IP. Other abbreviations (e.g. Some/IP) are wrong and shall
   not be used.

   The basic motivation to specify “yet another RPC-Mechanism” instead of using an existing
   infrastructure/technology is the goal to have a technology that:

   *  Fulfills the hard requirements regarding resource consumption in an embedded world.
   *  Is compatible through as many use cases and communication partners as possible.
   *  Is compatible with AUTOSAR at least on the on-wire format level; i.e. can communicate with
      PDUs AUTOSAR can receive and send without modification to the AUTOSAR standard.
   *  Provides the features required by automotive use cases.
   *  Is scalable from tiny to large platforms.
   *  Can be implemented on different operating system (e.g. AUTOSAR, GENIVI, and OSEK) and even
      embedded devices without operating system.

   :status: valid

   *  Method – a method, procedure, function, or subroutine that is called/invoked.
   *  Parameters – input, output, or input/output arguments of a method or an event.

   *  Input/output arguments are arguments shared for input and output.

   *  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) – a method call from one ECU to another that is transmitted using messages.
   *  Request – a message of the client to the server invoking a method.
   *  Response – a message of the server to the client transporting results of a method invocation.
   *  Request/Response communication – an RPC that consists of request and response.
   *  Fire&Forget communication – an RPC call that consists only of a request message.
   *  Event – a "Fire&Forget callback" that is only invoked on changes or cyclically and is sent
      from Server to Client.
   *  Field – a representation of a remote property, which has up to one getter, up to one setter,
      and up to one notifier.

   *  The field shall contain at least a getter, a setter, or a notifier.
   *  A field represents a status and thus has a valid value at all times on which getter, setter,
      and notifier act upon.

   *  Notification Event – an event message the notifier of an field sends. The message of such a
      notifier cannot be distinguished from the event message; therefore, when referring to the
      message of an event, this should also be true for the messages of notifiers of fields.
   *  Initial Event – the first transmission of a Notification Event of a Field after start of
      subscription to transport the initial (i.e. current) values of that Field.
   *  Getter – a Request/Response call that allows read access to a field.

      *  The getter needs to return a value; thus, it needs to be a request/response call.

   *  Setter – a Request/Response call that allows write access to a field.

      *  The setter is a request/response call as well in order for the client to know whether the
         setter-operation succeeded.

   *  Notifier – sends out event message with a new value on change of the value of the field
   *  Service – a logical combination of zero or more methods, zero or more events, and zero or more
      fields (empty service is allowed, e.g. for announcing non-SOME/IP services in SOME/IP-SD).
   *  Eventgroup – a logical grouping of events and notification events of fields inside a service
      in order to allow subscription
   *  Service Interface – the formal specification of the service including its methods, events, and fields
   *  Service Instance – software implementation of the service interface, which can exist more than
      once in the vehicle and more than once on an ECU
   *  Server – The ECU offering a service instance is called server in the context of this service instance.
   *  Client – The ECU using the service instance of a server is called client in the context of
      this service instance.
   *  Union or Variant – a data structure that dynamically assumes different data types.
   *  Endpoint – the combination of IP address, Layer 4 protocol, and port number.

   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Service Instance IDs of 0x0000 and 0xFFFF shall not be used for a service instance, since
   0x0000 is reserved and 0xFFFF is used to describe all service instances.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_544
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Different service instances within the same vehicle shall have different Service Instance IDs.

   This means that two different camera services shall have two different Service Instance IDs
   SI-ID-1 and SI-ID-2. For all vehicles of a vehicle project SI-ID-1 shall be the same. The same is
   true for SI-ID-2. If considering another vehicle project, different IDs may be used but it makes
   sense to use the same IDs among different vehicle projects for ease in testing and integration.

   It is a common practice and a recommendation to split the ID space of the Method ID between
   Methods and Events/Notifications. Methods would be in the range 0x0000-0x7FFF
   (first bit of Method ID is 0) and Events/Notifications would use the range 0x8000-0x8FFF
   (first bit of the Method-ID is 1).

   :status: valid

   Serialization describes the way data is represented in protocol data units (PDUs) transported
   over an IP-based automotive in-vehicle network.

Transport Protocol
******************

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_31

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_32
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP shall be transported using UDP and/or TCP based on the configuration. For dynamic ports
   the ECU private port range is 49152-65535 until further notice. When used in a vehicle the OEM
   will specify the ports used in the interface specification.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_659
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The IP addresses and port numbers an ECU shall use, shall be taken from the configuration file(s),
   for example in FLYNC.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_660
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The client shall take the IP address and port number the server announces using SOME/IP-SD
   (see :need:`feat_req_someipsd_752`) for communicating with the server.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_658
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   A very common port number for SOME/IP-SD is 30490/UDP but this shall be overwritten,
   if another port number is specified in the configuration.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_676
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The port 30490 (UDP and TCP as well) shall be only used for SOME/IP-SD and not used for
   applications communicating over SOME/IP.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_661
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   If an ECU needs to dynamically use a port number, it shall follow the rules of IETF and IANA for that:

   *  Ephemeral ports from range 49152-65535 (or what is defined for ECU)

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_33
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   It is recommended to use UDP for as many messages as possible and see TCP as fall-back for
   message requiring larger size. UDP allows the application to better control of timings and
   behavior when errors occur.

Message Length Limitations
==========================

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_34

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_35
   :reqtype: Information

   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   In combination with regular Ethernet, IPv4 and UDP can transport packets with up to 1472 bytes of
   data without fragmentation, while IPv6 uses additional 20 bytes. Especially for small systems
   fragmentation should be avoided, so the SOME/IP header and payload will be of limited length.
   The possible usage of security protocols further limits the maximal size of SOME/IP messages.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_36
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Best practice:

   When using UDP as transport protocol SOME/IP messages use up to 1416 bytes for the SOME/IP
   header and payload, so that 1400 bytes are available for the payload.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_38

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_42
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   All RPC-Headers shall be encoded in network byte order (big endian). The byte order of the
   parameters inside the payload shall be defined by the interface specification
   (e.g. FLYNC, FIBEX, ARXML, or FRANCA IDL) and shall be in network byte order when possible and
   if no other byte order is specified.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_675
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   This means that Length and Type fields shall be always in network byte order.

Header

   :id: feat_req_someip_44
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For interoperability reasons the header layout shall be identical for all implementations of
   SOME/IP and is shown in the Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_45`. The fields are presented in
   transmission order; i.e. the fields on the top left are transmitted first. In the following
   sections the different header fields and their usage is being described.

   When End-to-End (E2E) communication protection is enabled, the E2E header is inserted after the
   Return Code as shown in the Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_103`, with its position determined by
   the configured Offset value. By default, the Offset is 64 bits, positioning the E2E header
   between the Return Code and the Payload.

   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Layout in Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_45` shows the basic header layout over IP and
   the transport protocol used.

Mapping of IP Addresses and Ports in Response and Error Messages
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_48

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_49
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For the response and error message the IP addresses and port number of the transport protocol
   shall match the request message. This means:

   *  Source IP address of response = destination IP address of request.
   *  Destination IP address of response = source IP address of request.
   *  Source port of response = destination port of request.
   *  Destination port of response = source port of request.
   *  The transport protocol (TCP or UDP) stays the same.

Message ID [32 bit]
===================

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_55

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_56
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Message ID is a 32 bit identifier that is used to dispatch the RPC call to a method of an
   application and to identify an event. The Message ID has to uniquely identify a method or
   event of a service.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_57
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The assignment of the Message ID is up to the user; however, the Message ID has to be unique for
   the whole system (i.e. the vehicle). The Message ID can be best compared to a CAN ID and should
   be handled with a comparable process. The next section describes how to structure the Message IDs
   in order to ease the organization of Message IDs.

Structure of the Message ID
---------------------------

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_58

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_59
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   In order to structure the different methods, events, and fields, they are clustered into services.
   Services have a set of methods, events, and fields as well as a Service ID, which is only used
   for this service. The events and notification events may in addition be assigned into a number
   eventgroups, which simplify the registration of events and notifiers.

   An event shall be part of zero to many eventgroups and an eventgroup shall  contain zero to many events.
   A field shall be part of zero to many eventgroups and an eventgroup can contain zero to many fields.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_670
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Currently empty eventgroups are not used and events as well as fields are mapped to at least one eventgroup.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_60
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For methods, the Message ID should be structured in 2^16 services with 2^15 methods:

   .. bitfield_directive:: images/bit_field/feat_req_someip_60.json


.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_67
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For events and notifications (see Notification or Publish/Subscribe), the Message ID should be
   structured as follows:

   .. bitfield_directive:: images/bit_field/feat_req_someip_67.json


Length [32 bit]
===============

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_76

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_77
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Length is a field of 32 bits containing the length in byte of the payload beginning with the
   Request ID/Client ID until the end of the SOME/IP-message.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_798
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP messages with a length value < 8 bytes shall be ignored.

Request ID [32 bit]
===================

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_78

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_79
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Request ID allows a client to differentiate multiple calls to the same method. Therefore,
   the Request ID has to be unique for a single client and server combination only. When generating
   a response message, the server has to copy the Request ID from the request to the response message.
   This allows the client to map a response to the issued request even with more than one request
   outstanding.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_80
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Request IDs might be reused as soon as the response arrived or is not expected to arrive anymore
   (timeout). In most automotive use cases a very low number of outstanding requests are expected.
   For small systems without the possibility of parallel requests, the Request ID might always be
   set to the same value.

Structure of the Request ID
---------------------------

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someip_82

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_83
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Request ID shall be constructed of the Client ID and Session ID:

   .. bitfield_directive:: images/bit_field/feat_req_someip_83.json


.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_699
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Client ID is the unique identifier for the calling client inside the ECU.

   Note: This means that the implementer of an ECU can define the Client IDs as required by his
   implementation and the Server does not need to know this layout or definitions because it just
   copies the complete Request ID in the response.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_701
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Client ID shall also support being unique in the overall vehicle by having a configurable
   prefix or fixed value (e.g. the most significant byte of Client ID being the diagnostics address
   or a configured Client ID for a given application/SW-C).

   For example:

   .. bitfield_directive:: images/bit_field/feat_req_someip_701.json


.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_88
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The Session ID is a unique identifier chosen by the client for each call.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_700
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   If session handling is not used, the Session ID shall be set to 0x0000.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_649
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   If session handling is used, the Session ID shall start with 0x0001.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_677
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   When the Session ID reaches 0xFFFF, it shall start with 0x0001 again.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_669
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Request/Response methods shall use session handling.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_667
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Events, notification events, and Fire&Forget methods shall use session handling if required by
   the application.

   This could be for example because of functional safety reasons or because SOME/IP-TP is required
   (see SOME/IP-TP).

.. feat_req::

   Regular request (message type 0x00) shall be answered by a response (message type 0x80), when
   no error occurred. If an error occurs, response message with a return code not equal to 0x00
   shall be sent. This could be a response message (0x80) or an exception message (message type 0x81).
   It is also possible to send a request that does not have a response message (message type 0x01).

   ACKs are defined for transport protocols (i.e. UDP) that do not acknowledge a received message.
   All the ACKs are currently reserved but not used.

   The 3rd highest bit of the Message Type (=0x20) shall be called TP-Flag and shall be set to 1 to
   signal that the current SOME/IP message is a segment. The other bits of the Message Type are set
   as specified in this section.

   For further information about SOME/IP-TP see SOME/IP-TP :need:`feat_req_someiptp_759`.

   Note: Segments of the Message Type Request (0x00) have the Message Type (0x20), segments of the

   The Return Code is used to signal whether a request was successfully been processed.
   For simplification of the header layout, every message transports the field Return Code.

   Best practice:
   The size of the SOME/IP payload field depends on the transport protocol used. With UDP the
   SOME/IP payload should be between 0 and 1400 bytes.

   The limitation to 1400 bytes is needed in order to allow for future changes to protocol stack
   (e.g. changing to IPv6 or adding security means). Since TCP supports segmentation of payloads,
   larger sizes are automatically supported.

   The serialization is based on the parameter list defined by the interface specification.
   To allow migration of the service interface the deserialization code shall ignore parameters
   attached to the end of previously known parameter list; i.e. parameters that were not defined in
   the interface specification used to generate or parameterize the deserialization code.

   The interface specification defines the exact position of all parameters in the PDU and has to
   consider the memory alignment. The serialization shall not try to automatically align parameters
   but shall be aligned as specified in the interface specification.

   The SOME/IP payload should be placed in memory so that the SOME/IP payload is suitable aligned.
   For infotainment ECUs an alignment of 8 bytes (i.e. 64 bits) should be achieved, for all ECU at
   least an alignment of 4 bytes shall be achieved.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_711
   :reqtype: Requirement

   Alignment is always calculated from start of the SOME/IP message.

   Note: If a parameter has to be aligned to x bytes, padding shall be inserted so that the relative
   position from start of the SOME/IP message (i.e. the position of the first header byte)
   modulo x equals 0.

   The serialization of a struct shall be close to the in-memory layout. This means, only the
   parameters shall be serialized sequentially into the buffer. Especially for structs it is
   important to consider the correct memory alignment. Insert reserved/padding elements in the
   interface specification if needed for alignment, since the SOME/IP implementation shall not
   automatically add such padding.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_652
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   So if for example a struct includes an uint8 and an uint32, they are just written sequentially
   into the buffer. This means that there is no padding between the uint8 and the first byte of the
   uint32; therefore, the uint32 might not be aligned.

   If a SOME/IP generator or similar encounters an interface specification that leads to an PDU not
   correctly aligned (e.g. because of an unaligned struct), the SOME/IP generator shall warn about a
   misaligned struct but shall not fail in generating the code.

   :reqtype: Requirement

   The length field of the struct describes the number of bytes of the struct.
   If the length is greater than the length of the struct as specified in the interface specification
   only the bytes specified in the interface specification shall be interpreted and the other bytes
   shall be skipped based on the length field.

   This allows for extensible structs which allow better migration of interfaces.

   The layout of arrays with dynamic length basically is based on the layout of fixed length arrays.
   To determine the size of the array the serialization adds a length field (default length: 32 bits)
   in front of the data, which counts the bytes of the array. The length does not include the size
   of the length field. Thus, when transporting an array with zero elements (and thus zero bytes),
   the length is set to zero.

   :status: valid

   The interface specification shall define the length of the length field.
   Length of 0, 8, 16, and 32 bits are allowed.

   If the length of the length field is set to 0 bits,
   the number of elements in the array has to be fixed; thus, being an array with fixed length.

   :reqtype: Requirement

   :status: valid

   A union (also called variant) is a parameter that can contain different types of elements.
   For example, if one defines a union of type uint8 and type uint16,
   the union shall carry an element of uint8 or uint16.

   It is clear that that when using different types of elements with different length the alignment
   of subsequent parameters is possibly distorted. To resolve this, padding might be needed.

   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   If the interface specification defines a union with a length field of 0 bits and types with
   different length, a SOME/IP implementation shall warn about this and use the length of the
   longest element and pad all others with zeros (0x00).

.. feat_req::

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_273
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The type field describes the type of the element. Possible values of the type field are defined
   by the interface specification for each union separately. The types are encoded as in the
   interface specification in ascending order starting with 1. The 0 is reserved for the NULL
   type – i.e. an empty union. The interface specification shall allow or disallow the usage of
   NULL for a Union/Variant.

.. feat_req::

   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The element is serialized depending on the type in the type field. This also defines the
   length of the data. All bytes behind the data that are covered by the length, are padding.
   The deserializer shall skip such bytes according to the length field. The value of the length
   field for each type shall be defined by the interface specification.

   In this example a length of the length field is specified as 32 bits. The union shall support a
   uint8 and a uint16 as elements. Both are padded to the 32 bit boundary (length=4 bytes).

   Maps or dictionaries can be easily described as an array of key-value-pairs.
   The most basic way to implement a map or dictionary would be an array of a struct with two
   fields: key and value. Since the struct has no length field, this is as efficient as a special
   map or dictionary type could be. When choosing key and value as uint16, a serialized map
   with 3 entries looks like this:

   In order to transport SOME/IP messages of IP different transport protocols may be used.
   SOME/IP currently supports UDP and TCP. Their bindings are explained in the following sections,
   while SOME/IP Design Rules and Guidelines document discusses which transport protocol to choose.

   All Transport Protocol Bindings shall support transporting more than one SOME/IP message in a
   Transport Layer PDU (i.e. UDP packet or TCP segment). This is called nPDU feature and support
   shall cover receiving and sending.

   If an ECU has a cyclic send task (meaning it sends only every x ms), the ECU shall support the
   nPDU feature even without configuration to minimize the number of IP packets transporting
   SOME/IP messages.

   Note: The nPDU feature works only on SOME/IP messages using the same socket. This requirement
   does not mean to combine SOME/IP messages of different sockets.

   Rationale for :need:`feat_req_someip_664`: When transporting multiple SOME/IP payloads via UDP or

   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Every ECU (independent of the number of controllers, cores, and IP addresses) shall support the
   internal de/multiplexing of SOME/IP messages, so that SOME/IP messages do not need to be sent
   more than once to this ECU and the maximum efficiency based on the nPDU feature can be achieved
   (this means that the ECU transports all SOME/IP messages to/from another ECU on exactly a single
   port number pair).

   The UDP binding of SOME/IP is straight forward by transporting SOME/IP messages in UDP packets.
   The SOME/IP messages shall not be fragmented. Therefore care shall be taken that SOME/IP messages
   are not too big, i.e. up to 1400 bytes of SOME/IP payload. Messages with bigger payload shall
   not be transported over UDP but with TCP or SOME/IP-TP see :need:`feat_req_someiptp_759`.

   A Service Instance can be identified through the combination of the Service ID combined with
   the socket (i.e. IP-address, transport protocol (UDP/TCP), and port number).
   It is recommended that instances use the same port number for UDP and TCP.
   If a service instance uses UDP port x, only this instance of the service and not another
   instance of the same service should use exactly TCP port x for its services.

Request/Response Communication

   One of the most common communication patterns is the request/response pattern.
   One communication partner (in the following called the client) sends a request message,
   which is answered by another communication partner (the server).

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_329
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For the SOME/IP request message the client has to do the following for payload and header:

   *  Construct the payload
   *  Set the Message ID based on the method the client wants to call
   *  Set the Length field to 8 bytes (for the part of the SOME/IP header after length field) +
      length of the serialized payload
   *  Optionally set the Request ID to a unique number (shall be unique for client only)
   *  Set the Protocol Version according :need:`feat_req_someip_89`.
   *  Set the Interface Version according to the interface specification
   *  Set the Message Type to Request (i.e. 0x00)
   *  Set the Return Code to 0x00

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_338
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The server builds its header based on the header of the client and does in addition:

   *  Construct the payload
   *  Set the length to the 8 bytes + new payload size
   *  Set the Message Type to RESPONSE (i.e. 0x80) or EXCEPTION (i.e. 0x81)
   *  Set the Return Code.

Fire&Forget Communication
*************************

   :id: feat_req_someip_345
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD

   :status: valid

   Requests without response message are called Fire&Forget. The implementation is basically
   the same as for Request/Response with the following differences:

   *  There is no response message.
   *  The message type is set to REQUEST_NO_RETURN (i.e. 0x01)

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_348
   :reqtype: Requirement

   Fire&Forget messages shall not return an error. Error handling shall be implemented by
   the application when needed.

Events

   Events describe a general Publish/Subscribe-Concept. Usually the server publishes a service and
   the client subscribes to one of the services eventgroups. On certain events the server will send
   the client an event, which could be for example an updated value or an event that occurred.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_353
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP is used only for transporting the updated value and not for the publishing and
   subscription mechanisms. These mechanisms are implemented by SOME/IP-SD and are explained in
   Section :need:`feat_req_someip_360`.

.. feat_req::

   :reqtype: Requirement

   When more than one subscribed client on the same ECU exists, the system shall handle
   the replication of events in order to save transmissions on the communication medium.
   This is especially important, when events are transported using multicast messages.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_804
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD

   SOME/IP implementations should support sending events (but not notification events of fields)
   to a subset of the subscribed clients.

   :id: feat_req_someip_806
   :reqtype: Requirement

   Sending events to a subset of the subscribed clients shall be controlled by the application.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_807
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   Events shall not be sent to clients that are not subscribed.

   Note: Events sent via multicast are not sent to the client but to the multicast addresses;
   therefore, multicast communication is not affected by this requirement.

   When designing a service with selective event sending, make sure that this works even if
   the feature is not supported by the sender.

   Example with using a handle:

   *  Client A <-> Server: Request-Response-Call (parameters) returns (handle1, ...)
   *  Client A <-> Server: Request-Response-Call (parameters) returns (handle2, ...)
   *  Client B <-> Server: Request-Response-Call (parameters) returns (handle3, ...)
   *  Server -> Client A: Selective Event E1 (handle2, ...)

   If Event E1 is being sent to all clients instead of only Client A, Client B could filter
   based on the handle; thus, compatibility is not broken. Only efficiency is lowered.


Strategy for sending notifications
==================================

.. heading::

   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For different use cases different strategies for sending notifications are possible and
   shall be defined in the service interface. The following examples are common:

   *  Cyclic update – send an updated value in a fixed interval. Only safety relevant messages
      protected with an Alive-Counter which increments cyclically shall be sent in fixed intervals.
   *  Update on change – send an update as soon as a “value” changes (e.g. door open).
   *  Epsilon change – only send an update when the difference to the last value is greater than
      a certain epsilon. This concept may be adaptive, i.e. the prediction is based on a history;
      thus, only when the difference between prediction and current value is greater than epsilon
      an update is transmitted.

Publish/Subscribe Handling
==========================

.. heading::

   :id: feat_req_someip_361
   :reqtype: Requirement

   A field shall be a combination of an optional getter, an optional setter, and an optional notifier.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_632
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD

   A field without a setter and without a getter and without a notifier shall not exist.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_633
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The getter of a field shall be a request/response call that has an empty payload in
   the request message and the value of the field in the payload of the response message.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_634
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The setter of a field shall be a request/response call that has the desired value of the field
   in the payload of the request message and the value that was set to the field in the payload of
   the response message.

   Note: If the value of the request payload was adapted (e.g. because it was out of limits)
   the adapted value will be transported in the response payload.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_635
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The notifier shall send a notification event message that communicates the updated value of
   a field on change and follows the rules for events. Sending strategies include on change,
   on epsilon change, and cyclic sending.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_1092

Transporting Application Error Codes and Exceptions

   :reqtype: Requirement

   :status: valid

   For error handling, two different mechanisms are supported. All messages have
   a return code field to carry the return code. However, responses (Message Types 0x80 )
   shall use this field to send a return code to the request (Message Type 0x00) they answer as per
   configuration. All other messages shall set this field to 0x00. See :need:`feat_req_someip_94`.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_106
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD

   It shall be possible to configure Message Type 0x81 to transmit the return codes that are
   not equal to 0x00.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_107
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   In any case, receiving return codes not equal to 0x00 shall be supported on both Message Types, 0x80 and 0x81.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_101
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   For more detailed errors the layout of the Exception Message (Message Type 0x81) can carry
   specific fields for error handling, e.g. an Exception String. Exception Messages can be sent
   in place of Response Messages only when configured. However, receiving return codes within
   Message Type 0x81 shall remain supported if configured.

   This can be used to handle all different application errors that might occur in the server.
   In addition, problems with the communication medium or intermediate components (e.g. switches)
   may occur, which have to be handled e.g. by means of reliable transport.

   For request/response methods the error message shall copy over the fields of the SOME/IP header
   (i.e. Message ID, Request ID, and Interface Version) but not the payload.
   In addition Message Type and Return Code have to be set to the appropriate values.

   For a more flexible error handling, SOME/IP allows the user to specify a message layout specific
   for errors instead of using the message layout for response messages.
   This is defined by the interface specification and can be used to transport exceptions of
   higher level programming languages.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_423
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   The recommended layout for the exception message is the following:

   *  Union of specific exceptions. At least a generic exception without fields needs to exist.
   *  Dynamic Length String for exception description.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_426
   :reqtype: Information

   The union gives the flexibility to add new exceptions in the future in a type-safe manner.
   The string is used to transport human readable exception descriptions to ease testing and debugging.

   Important things that are reflected in this flow chart:

   *  Error handling is based on the message type received (e.g. only methods can be answered with
      a return code).
   *  Errors shall be checked in a defined order (see :need:`feat_req_someip_721`).

   The error codes E_UNKNOWN_SERVICE and E_UNKNOWN_METHOD are optional.
   This means they may be sent on Request messages of Request/Response methods,
   if the Service ID or the Method ID is wrong.

   The error code E_WRONG_PROTOCOL_VERSION is obsolete since it should only be sent,
   if the version of SOME/IP has changed (meaning the header layout) and the message type is request.
   This cannot be implemented correctly.

Communication Errors and Handling of Communication Errors

   When considering the transport of RPC messages different reliability semantics exist:

   *  Maybe – the message might reach the communication partner
   *  At least once – the message reaches the communication partner at least once
   *  Exactly once – the message reaches the communication partner exactly once

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_434

   When using these terms in regard to Request/Response the term applies to both messages
   (i.e. request and response or error).

   :reqtype: Information
   :security: TBD
   :safety: TBD
   :status: valid

   While different implementations may implement different approaches,
   SOME/IP currently achieves “maybe” reliability when using the UDP bindings including SOME/IP-TP and
   “exactly once” reliability when using the TCP binding. Further error handling is left to the application.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someip_436

   For “maybe” reliability, only a single timeout is needed,
   when using request/response communication in combination of UDP as transport protocol.
   Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_437` shows the state machines for “maybe” reliability.
   The client’s SOME/IP implementation has to wait for the response for a specified timeout.
   If the timeout occurs SOME/IP shall signal E_TIMEOUT to the client application.

   Additional mechanisms to reach higher reliability may be implemented in the application or
   in a SOME/IP implementation. Keep in mind that the communication does not have to implement
   these features. The next section :need:`feat_req_someip_440` describes such optional reliability
   mechanisms.

Application based Error Handling

   The application can easily implement “at least once” reliability by using idempotent operations
   (i.e. operation that can be executed multiple times without side effects) and
   using a simple timeout mechanism. Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_443` shows the state machines
   for “at least once” reliability using implicit acknowledgements.
   When the client sends out the request it starts a timer with the timeout specified for the specific method.
   If no response is received before the timer expires (round transition at the top),
   the client will retry the operation. A typical number of retries would be 2, so that 3 requests are sent.
