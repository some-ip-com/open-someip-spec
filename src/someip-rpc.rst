The basic motivation to specify “yet another RPC-Mechanism” instead of using an existing infrastructure/technology is the goal to have a technology that:

* Fulfills the hard requirements regarding resource consumption in an embedded world.
* Is compatible through as many use-cases and communication partners as possible.
* Is compatible with AUTOSAR at least on the wire-format level; i.e. can communicate with PDUs AUTOSAR can receive and send without modification to the AUTOSAR standard.
* Provides the features required by automotive use-cases.
* Is scalable from tiny to large platforms.
* Can be implemented on different operating system (i.e. AUTOSAR, GENIVI, and OSEK) and even embedded devices without operating system.

* Method – a method, procedure, function, or subroutine that is called/invoked.
* Parameters – input, output, or input/output arguments of a method or an event.

  * Input/output arguments are arguments shared for input and output.

* Remote Procedure Call (RPC) – a method call from one ECU to another that is transmitted using messages.
* Request – a message of the client to the server invoking a method.
* Response – a message of the server to the client transporting results of a method invocation.
* Request/Response communication – a RPC that consists of request and response.
* Fire&Forget communication – a RPC call that consists only of a request message.
* Event – a "Fire&Forget callback" that is only invoked on changes or cyclically and is sent from Server to Client.
* Field – a representation of a remote property, which has up to one getter, up to one setter, and up to one notifier.

  * The field shall contain at least a getter, a setter, or a notifier.
  * A field does represent a status and thus has an valid value at all times on which getter, setter, and notifier act upon.

* Notification Event – an event message the notifier of an field sends. The message of such a notifier cannot be distinguished from the event message; therefore, when referring to the message of an event, this shall also be true for the messages of notifiers of fields.
* Getter – a Request/Response call that allows read access to a field.
* Setter – a Request/Response call that allows write access to a field.

  * The getter needs to return a value; thus, it needs to be a request/response call. The setter is a request/response call as well in order for the client to know whether the setter-operation succeeded.

* Notifier – sends out event message with a new value on change of the value of the field
* Service – a logical combination of zero or more methods, zero or more events, and zero or more fields (empty service is allowed, e.g. for announcing non-SOME/IP services in SOME/IP-SD).
* Eventgroup – a logical grouping of events and notification events of fields inside a service in order to allow subscription
* Service Interface – the formal specification of the service including its methods, events, and fields
* Service Instance – software implementation of the service interface, which can exist more than once in the vehicle and more than once on an ECU
* Server – The ECU offering a service instance shall be called server in the context of this service instance.
* Client – The ECU using the service instance of a server shall be called client in the context of this service instance.
* Union or Variant – a data structure that dynamically assumes different data types.

The Message ID is a 32 Bit identifier that is used to dispatch the RPC call to a method of an application and to identify an event. The Message ID has to uniquely identify a method or event of a service.

The assignment of the Message ID is up to the user; however, the Message ID has to be unique for the whole system (i.e. the vehicle). The Message ID can be best compared to a CAN ID and should be handled with a comparable process.

In order to structure the different methods, events, and fields, they are clustered into services. Services have a set of methods, events, and fields as well as a Service ID, which is only used for this service. The events and notification events may in addition be assigned into a number eventgroups, which simplify the registration of events and notifies.

An event shall be part of zero to many eventgroups and an eventgroup shall  contain zero to many events.
A field shall be part of zero to many eventgroups and an eventgroup can contain zero to many fields.

The Request ID allows a client to differentiate multiple calls to the same method. Therefore, the Request ID has to be unique for a single client and server combination only. When generating a response message, the server has to copy the Request ID from the request to the response message. This allows the client to map a response to the issued request even with more than one request outstanding.

Request IDs might be reused as soon as the response arrived or is not expected to arrive anymore (timeout). In most automotive use cases a very low number of outstanding requests are expected. For small systems without the possibility of parallel requests, the Request ID might always set to the same value.

The Client ID is the unique identifier for the calling client inside the ECU.

Note: This means that the implementer of an ECU can define the Client-IDs as required by his implementation and the Server does not need to know this layout or definitions because he just copies the complete Request-ID in the response.

Regular request (message type 0x00) will be answered by a response (message type 0x80), when no error occurred. If errors occur an error message (message type 0x81) will be sent. It is also possible to send a request that does not have a response message (message type 0x01). For updating values through notification a callback interface exists (message type 0x02).

The limitation to 1400 Bytes is needed in order to allow for future changes to protocol stack (e.g. changing to IPv6 or adding security means). Since TCP supports segmentation of payloads, larger sizes are automatically supported.

The serialization is based on the parameter list defined by the interface specification.

The interface specification defines the exact position of all parameters in the PDU and has to consider the memory alignment. The serialization shall not try to automatically align parameters but shall be aligned as specified in the interface specification.

The SOME/IP payload should be placed in memory so that the SOME/IP payload is suitable aligned. For infotainment ECUs an alignment of 8 Bytes (i.e. 64 bits) should be achieved, for all ECU at least an alignment of 4 Bytes shall be achieved.

Alignment is always calculated from start of SOME/IP message.

Note:

The serialization of a struct shall be close to the in-memory layout. This means, only the parameters shall be serialized sequentially into the buffer. Especially for structs it is important to consider the correct memory alignment. Insert reserved/padding elements in the interface definition if needed for alignment, since the SOME/IP implementation shall not automatically add such padding.

So if for example a struct includes an uint8 and an uint32, they are just written sequentially into the buffer. This means that there is no padding between the uint8 and the first byte of the uint32; therefore, the uint32 might not be aligned.

The layout of arrays with dynamic length basically is based on the layout of fixed length arrays. To determine the size of the array the serialization adds a length field (default length 32 bit) in front of the data, which counts the bytes of the array. The length does not include the size of the length field. Thus, when transporting an array with zero elements the length is set to zero.

The Interface Definition shall define the length of the length field. Length of 0, 8, 16, and 32bit are allowed.

If the length of the length field is set to 0 Bits, the number of elements in the array has to be fixed; thus, being an array with fixed length.

Since the struct has no length field, this is as efficient as a special map or dictionary type could be. When choosing key and value as uint16, a serialized map with 3 entries looks like this:

The UDP binding of SOME/IP is straight forward by transporting SOME/IP messages in UDP packets. The SOME/IP messages shall not be fragmented. Therefore care shall be taken that SOME/IP messages are not too big, i.e. up to 1400 Bytes of SOME/IP payload. Messages with bigger payload shall not be transported over UDP but with e.g. TCP.

The header format allows transporting more than one SOME/IP message in a single UDP packet. The SOME/IP implementation shall identify the end of a SOME/IP message by means of the SOME/IP length field. Based on the UDP length field, SOME/IP shall determine if there are additional SOME/IP messages in the UDP packet.

As optimization the UDP binding of SOME/IP can use acknowledgment messages especially for request/response communication that triggers a long running operation at server side that shall be completed before sending a result (transport or processing acknowledgement). The acknowledgment messages are SOME/IP messages with exactly the same header fields but with the changed message type and without a payload. The use of these additional acknowledgment messages shall be configured by the interface specification.

An alternative would be to design a method with an return code or out parameter that specifies "operation still in progress", so that the requesting ECU can ask again after a certain time.

For different use cases different strategies for sending notifications are possible and shall be defined in the service interface. The following examples are common:

* Cyclic update – send an updated value in a fixed interval (e.g. every 100 ms for safety relevant messages with Alive)
* Update on change – send an update as soon as a “value” changes (e.g. door open)
* Epsilon change – only send an update when the difference to the last value is greater than a certain epsilon. This concept may be adaptive, i.e. the prediction is based on a history; thus, only when the difference between prediction and current value is greater than epsilon an update is transmitted.

For the error handling two different mechanisms are supported. All messages have a return code field to carry the return code. However, only responses (Message Types 0x80 and 0x81) use this field to carry a return code to the request (Message Type 0x00) they answer. All other messages set this field to 0x00. See :need:`feat_req_someip_94`.

For more detailed errors the layout of the Error Message (Message Type 0x81) can carry specific fields for error handling, e.g. an Exception String. Error Messages are sent instead of Response Messages.

While different implementations may implement different approaches, SOME/IP currently achieves “maybe” reliability when using the UDP binding and “exactly once” reliability when using the TCP binding. Further error handling is left to the application.

For “maybe” reliability, only a single timeout is needed, when using request/response communication in combination of UDP as transport protocol. Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_437` shows the state machines for “maybe” reliability. The client’s SOME/IP implementation has to wait for the response for a specified timeout. If the timeout occurs SOME/IP shall signal E_TIMEOUT to the client application.

The application can easily implement “at least once” reliability by using idempotent operations (i.e. operation that can be executed multiple times without side effects) and using a simple timeout mechanism. Figure :need:`feat_req_someip_443` shows the state machines for “at least once” reliability using implicit acknowledgements. When the client sends out the request it starts a timer with the timeout specified for the specific method. If no response is received before the timer expires (round transition at the top), the client will retry the operation. A Typical number of retries would be 2, so that 3 requests are sent.

SOME/IP directly supports the two most used transport protocols of the Internet: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). While UDP is a very lean transport protocol supporting only the most important features (multiplexing and error detecting using a checksum), TCP adds additional features for achieving a reliable communication. TCP can not only handle bit errors but also segmentation, loss, duplication, reordering, and network congestion; thus, TCP is the more powerful transport protocol.

    :collapse: True
  
For use inside the vehicle, requirements are not the same as for the Internet. For many applications, we require a very short timeout to react in a very short time. These requirements are better met using UDP because the application itself can handle the unlikely event of errors. For example, in use cases with cyclic data it is often the best approach to just wait for the next data transmission instead of trying to repair the last one. The major disadvantage of UDP is that it does not handle segmentation; thus, only being able to transport smaller chunks of data.

For the serialization of data structures containing pointers (e.g. a tree in memory), the pointers cannot be just transferred using a data type (e.g. uint8) but shall be converted for transport. Different approaches for the serialization of pointers exist. We recommend the following approaches.

* Add an offset field to every message. The ID of an array element will be calculated by adding the offset to its position in the array. Keep in mind that the offset needs to be carefully chosen.

When the receiver of a message adds for example a new parameter to be received, it has to define a default value. This is needed in the case of a sender with an older version of the service sends the message without the additional parameter.

Transporting CAN and FlexRay Frames

SOME/IP allows to tunnel of CAN and FlexRay frames as well. However, the Message ID space needs to be coordinated between both use cases.

The Message ID and Length are used to construct the needed internal PDUs but does not look at other fields. Therefore, the CAN ID (11 or 29 bits) and/or the FlexRay ID (6+6+11 bits) have to be encoded into the Message ID field. The CAN ID shall be aligned to the least significant bit of the Message ID. An 11 bit CAN identifier would be therefore transported in the bit position 21 to 31. Refer also to :need:`feat_req_someip_620`

    :collapse: True
  
Especially with the use of 29 Bit CAN-IDs or FlexRay-IDs a lot of the Message ID space is used. In this case it is recommended to bind SOME/IP and CAN/FlexRay transports to different transport protocol ports, so that different ID spaces for the Message IDs exist.

Keep in mind that when transporting a CAN frame of 8 Byte over Ethernet an overhead of up to 100 Bytes might be needed in the near future (using IPv6 and/or security mechanisms). So it is recommended to use larger RPC calls as shown in the first part of the document instead of small CAN like communication.

At least for 11 Bit CAN-IDs the layout of the Message ID shall be followed :need:`feat_req_someip_60` and :need:`feat_req_someip_67`. This means that the 16th bit from the left shall be set to 0 or 1 according to the Message ID (0x00 or 0x02).

If SOME/IP is used for transporting CAN messages with 11 Bits of CAN-ID, the following layout of the Message ID is recommended (example):

* Service ID shall be set to a value defined by the OEM, e.g. 0x1234
* Event ID is split into 4 Bits specifying the CAN bus, and 11 Bits for the CAN-ID.

This is just an example and the actual layout shall be specified by the OEM.
