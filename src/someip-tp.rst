Transporting large SOME/IP messages over UDP (SOME/IP-TP)
#########################################################

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_760
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The UDP binding of SOME/IP can only transport SOME/IP messages that fit directly into an
   Ethernet frame, since IP fragmentation is not being used. Currently this limits the payload of
   such messages to 1400 bytes. If larger SOME/IP messages need to be transported over UDP
   (e.g. 128 kB) the SOME/IP Transport Protocol (SOME/IP-TP), as specified in this chapter, shall be used.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_764
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The SOME/IP message, which is too big to be transported directly with the UDP binding, shall be
   called "original" SOME/IP message. The "pieces" of the original SOME/IP message payload transported
   in SOME/IP-TP messages shall be called "segments".

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_762
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP messages using SOME/IP-TP shall activate Session Handling (Session ID must be unique for the original message).

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_763
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   All SOME/IP-TP segments shall carry the Session ID of the original message; thus, they all have the same Session ID.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_765
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP-TP segments shall have the TP-Flag of the Message Type set to 1 :need:`feat_req_someip_761`.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_766
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP-TP segments shall have a TP header right after the SOME/IP header
   (i.e. before the SOME/IP payload) with the following structure (bits from highest to lowest),
   as also shown in figure :need:`feat_req_someiptp_832`:

   * Offset [28 bits]
   * Reserved Flag [3 bits]
   * More Segments Flag [1 bit]

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_832
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO

   :status: valid

   Figure: TP Header for SOME/IP-TP Segments

   .. bitfield_directive:: images/bit_field/feat_req_someiptp_832.json

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_768
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Offset field shall transport the upper 28 bits of a uint32. The lower 4 bits shall always be
   interpreted as '0'.

   Note: This means that the 28 bit offset field always represents offset values that are multiples
   of 16 bytes.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_767
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Offset field of the TP header shall be set to the offset in bytes of the transported segment in the original message.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_769
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Reserved Flags shall be set to 0 by the sender and shall be ignored (and not checked) by the receiver.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_770
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The More Segments Flag shall be set to 1 for all segments except the last segment.
   For the last segment the More Segments Flag shall be set to 0.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_771
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The SOME/IP length field shall be used as specified before. This means it covers all but the
   first 8 bytes of the SOME/IP header and all bytes after that.

   Note: This means that for a SOME/IP-TP message transporting a segment, the SOME/IP length
   covers 8 bytes of the SOME/IP header, the 4 bytes of the TP header, and the segment itself.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_772
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The length of a segment must reflect the alignment of the next segment based on the offset field.
   Therefore, all but the last segment shall have a length that is a multiple of 16 bytes.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_773
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   Since UDP-based SOME/IP messages are limited to 1400 bytes payload, the maximum length of
   a segment that is correctly aligned is 87 x 16 bytes = 1392 bytes.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_774
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   SOME/IP-TP messages shall use the same Message ID (i.e. Service ID and Method ID),
   Request ID (i.e. Client ID and Session ID), Protocol Version, Interface Version,
   and Return Code as the original message.

   Note: As described above the Length, Message Type, and Payload are adapted by SOME/IP-TP.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_801
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   ECUs using SOME/IP-TP shall implement traffic shaping for the segments in order to control network bursts.

   Note: This does not mean that one shaper per SOME/IP-TP message is required but a shaper can cover multiple SOME/IP messages.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_777
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The sender shall send segments in ascending order.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_778
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The sender shall segment in a way that all segments with the More Segment Flag set to 1 are of the same size.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_779
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The sender shall try to maximize the size of the segments within limitations imposed by this specification.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_780
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM

   The sender shall not send overlapping or duplicated segments.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_786
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM

   The sender shall only use as many different Client IDs for a message that uses SOME/IP-TP as
   determined by the configuration.

Receiver specific behavior
**************************

.. heading::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_776

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_781
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver shall match segments for reassembly based on the configured values of Message ID,
   Protocol-Version, Interface-Version, and Message Type (w/o TP Flag) as well as the dynamic value
   of the Request ID.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_794
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The configured header values shall be used to select the "reassembly buffer" or similar.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_787
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   It shall be supported to reassemble the same message from different clients (difference in
   Sender IP, Sender Port, or Client ID but otherwise equal) in parallel. This should be controlled
   by configuration and determines the amount of "reassembly buffers".

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_795
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Session ID shall be used to detect the next original message to be reassembled.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_793
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver shall start a new reassembly (and possibly throw away old segments that were not
   successfully reassembled), if a new segment with a different Session ID is received.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_782
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver should only reassemble up to its configured buffer size and skip the rest of the message.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_783
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   Only correctly reassembled message of up to the configured size shall be passed to an application.

   Note: This means that the implementation must make sure that all bytes of the message must be
   bytes that were received and reassembled correctly. Counting non-overlapping, non-duplicated
   bytes and comparing this to the length could be a valid check.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_784
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Return Code of the last segment used for reassembly shall be used for the reassembled message.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_785
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The Message Type of an incoming SOME/IP message shall be passed to the application after
   reassembly with the TP Flag set to 0.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_789
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver shall support reassembly of segments that are received in ascending order.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_820
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver should support reassembly of segments that are received in descending order.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_790
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver should use limited resources to support reassembly of reordered segments of a single
   original message. A reorder distance of 3 should be supported (i.e. segments are allowed up to
   3 positions away from their correct place in sequence).

   Note: This could mean for example that the receiver can only desegment if segments are in order
   but it stores the last 4 segments and sorts them before trying to deserialize. Or it could mean
   that all segments are written into a buffer and 4 meta data structures (e.g. start and length)
   to store which data of the buffer is valid are present. Thus, limiting the memory requirements
   for the meta data.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_796
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver shall cancel desegmentation for a single original message, if missing segments of
   this original message are detected and resources do not permit to further wait on the segment
   (e.g. because the next message already starts or reorder distance is higher than expected).

   Note: This means that reordering inside a single original message is allowed, if resources permit this.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_802
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   Reordering of segments belonging to different original messages but using the same buffer
   (e.g. only the Session ID and payload are different) is currently not allowed, since this could
   lead to reordering of original messages and breaking "last is best" semantics.

   Note: This prohibits that equal events (same Message ID, IP-Addresses, ports numbers,
   and transport protocol) arrive in the wrong order.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_803
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   Reordering of segments of completely different original messages (e.g. Message ID is different)
   is not of concern since those segments go to different buffers.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_797
   :reqtype: Information
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver should correctly reassemble overlapping and duplicated segments by overwriting using
   the content of the first segment received.

   Example:

   1. Segment 0..2 = 111
   2. Segment 1..3 = 222
   3. Reassembled Message = 1112

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_810
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver may cancel reassembly, if overlapping or duplicated segments change already written
   bytes in the buffer, if this feature can be turned off by configuration.

.. feat_req::
   :id: feat_req_someiptp_792
   :reqtype: Requirement
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The receiver shall be able to detect and handle obvious errors gracefully.

   E.g. cancel reassembly if segment length of a segment with MS=1 is not a multiple of 16.

   Note: This means that buffer overflows or other malfunction shall be prevented by the receiving code.
